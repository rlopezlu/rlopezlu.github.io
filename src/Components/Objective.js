          <p >I am looking for my first full time software development job. I have
            experience working with multiple parts of the javascript web dev stack
            using Node.js and compatible npm repos. Angular, React, and Vue are very
            powerful frameworks that I have spent a lot of time with. I have worked with
            mongodb and postgresql.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love working in small teams, but am also very independent
            and value autonomy. I have participated in hackathons and project based
            classes where team organzation and colaboration were critical in order
            to meet deadlines and complete sprints.
